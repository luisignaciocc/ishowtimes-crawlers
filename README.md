# Cinema Crawlers

Crawler scripts to test the CRAWL-E Framework

There's 2 folders: `tutorials` with crawl-e documentation tutorials, and `tasks` with scripts to crawl several cinema websites.

The `task` folder contains a `single-cinema-crawler` folder, with scripts for different independant cinemas, and a `cinema-chain-crawler` folder for scripts for cinema chains.

The scripts are sorted by difficulty level

Not all the scripts are completed, some of them are a work in progress and some of the are not working
