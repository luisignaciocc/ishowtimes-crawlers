# Cinema Crawlers

Cinema Crawlers is a collection of crawler scripts designed to test the CRAWL-E Framework. The repository contains two folders: `tutorials` and `tasks`.

## Tutorials

The tutorials folder contains all the scripts provided by the Crawl-E Framework documentation.

## Tasks

The tasks folder contains crawler scripts for several cinema websites. This folder is divided into two subfolders: `single-cinema-crawler` and `cinema-chain-crawler`.

### Single Cinema Crawler

The single-cinema-crawler folder contains scripts for independent cinemas. The scripts are sorted by difficulty level, and not all of them are working.

### Cinema Chain Crawler

The cinema-chain-crawler folder contains scripts for cinema chains. These scripts are also sorted by difficulty level. Some of them are a work in progress and some of them are not working correctly.
